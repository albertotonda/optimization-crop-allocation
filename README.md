# Multi-objective optimization of crop allocation

This repository contains the data and code used for the experiments in Chen et al., 2024, "Multi-Objective Optimization for Large-scale Allocation of Soybean Crops", in: Proceedings of the annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation (GECCO), DOI: 10.1145/3638529.3654026

In order to run an experiment, you will need python: `python3 src/soja_multi_objective.py`
