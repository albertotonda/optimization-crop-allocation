# optimiziation-crop-allocation
Repository for the project with David Makowski

## Summary
We have crop yields (predicted or recorded/detrended) for several years, in a time series, for several adjacent regions. In the most recent case, soy allocation.

## TODO
EA (single- or multi-objective), using threads. Also look into efficient matrix manipulation.
